Electrolysis of KBr(aq) gives Br 2 at anode but KF(aq) does not give F 2. Give reason. Ans. Oxidation takes place at anode. Now higher the oxidation Potential, easier to oxidize. Oxidation potential of Br -, H2O,F -are in the following order. Br->H 2 O>F- Therefore in aq. Solution of KBr. Br -ions are oxidized to Br 2 in preference to H 2 O. On the other hand, in aq. Solution of KF, H 2 O is oxidized in preference to F -. Thus in this case oxidation of H 2 O at anode gives O 2 and no F 2 is produced. 3. What happens when a piece of copper is added to (a) an aq solution of FeSO 4 (b) an Aq solution of FeCl 3 ? a. Nothing will happen when the piece of copper is added to FeSo4 because reduction potential E0 Cu2/Cu(0.34) is more than the reduction potential E0(Fe2+/Fe) (0.44V). b.

Obtained from a cell. 3. it is responsible for steady flow of 3.it is not responsible for steady Current. Flow of current. 2. Why an electrochemical cell stops working after sometime? The reduction potential of an electrode depends upon the concentration of solution with which it is in contact. As the cell works, the concentration of reactants decrease. Then according to Le chatelier’s principle it will shift the equilibrium in backward direction. On the other hand if the concentration is more on the reactant side then it will shift the equilibrium in forward direction. When cell works concentration in anodic compartment in cathodic compartment decrease and hence E 0 cathode will decrease. Now EMF of cell is E 0 cell = E 0 cathode – E 0 anode A decrease in E 0 cathode and a corresponding increase in E 0 anode wil mean that EMF of the cell will decrease and will ultimately become zero i.e., cell stops working after some time. 3. for the standard cell Cu(s)/Cu + (aq)|| Ag + (aq)/Ag(s) E 0 cell 2+/ Cu = +0.34 V E 0 cell 2+ =+0.34 V E 0 Ag + /Ag =+0.80 V i. identify the cathode and the anode as the current is drawn from the cell. ii.

Can we store copper sulphate in (i)Zinc vessel (ii) Silver vessel? Give reasons . Given E 0 Cu 2+ /Cu = +0.34V, E 0 Zn 2+ /Zn= -0.76V) , E0Ag + /Ag = +0.80V Ans. A metal having lower reduction potential can displace a metal having higher reduction potential from solution of its salt.of Cu 2+ (E 0 Cu 2+ /C I. Since standard reduction potential of Zn 2+ (E 0 Zn 2+ /Zn = -0.76V) is less than the standard reduction potentialof Cu 2+ (E 0 Cu 2+ /Cu=+0.34V), Zn can displace copper from copper sulphate solution.
